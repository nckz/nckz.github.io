title: PyScript; Scientific Edge Computing Soon

summary: Some examples of PyScript implementations running Python client-side.
---

Just as I was thinking I should dive deeper into JavaScript tools for science,
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) (a widely used Python distribution) does
something amazing; they're making client-side Python easy and accessible with
[PyScript](https://pyscript.net)! Yay.  This reminds me of the potential for
edge computing and the sharing of scientific algorithms when Google released
[PNaCl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Native_Client).  One of main
difficulties with research is enabling others to reproduce results; Python
(and tools like Numpy) have made this easier; but they still leaves out those
that are less code savvy.  I love the idea of bringing domain knowledge and
works from the benchtop directly to the interested user, especially in blog
form.

I wanted to see how easy it would be to setup some simple (and powerful) data
plotting examples in this Hugo based blog.  This details the steps I had to
troubleshoot to get multiple examples working on the same page.


# Examples
The following examples were taken from another
[blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/create-an-interactive-web-app-with-pyscript-and-pandas-3918ad2dada1).
They incorporate some essential tools like tabular data objects with
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and plotting with both
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com).

## Matplotlib and Pandas Example
This example is a direct implementation from the tutorial
[Create an Interactive Web App with Pyscript](https://towardsdatascience.com/create-an-interactive-web-app-with-pyscript-and-pandas-3918ad2dada1).

### Weather Data

## Plotly and Pandas Example
Building on the previous example from [How to Use Plotly with PyScript](https://medium.com/technofile/how-to-use-ploty-with-pyscript-578d3b287293).

# The Trouble
The issues I ran into were not so bad, but, I figured this might help the next
dev.

## First Rendering HTML
I was hoping that the html could be directly injected into the markdown text;
this resulted in a few errors due to the markdown processing of the post page.
The python code would be directly rendered to the page instead of executing
e.g.

```html
<html>

<link rel="stylesheet"
	href="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.css" />
<script defer
	src="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.js">
</script>

<py-env>
  - pandas
</py-env>

<py-script>

print("hello world")

</py-script>

</html>
```

results in

> print("hello world")

however, this can be easily remedied by making a Hugo
[shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/). For my build
the html content was put into a file with this path
`layouts/shortcodes/pyscript_print_hello.html`.

The short code:

```
{{</* pyscript_print_hello */>}}
```

results in

> {{< pyscript_print_hello >}}

### Wrong Double-Quote Character
I also had an issue with copying code from pages with example code.  Somehow
the double-quote was not recognized by the Python interpreter and this resulted
in an exception thrown in [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/). I'm not
sure why I can't reproduce it now.

## Python Interpreter Session
It wasn't obvious to me that successive py-script runs will execute code in the
same interpreter scope/session. This means that care should be taken when naming
variables and definitions within each script.  For example, the `plot` command
was renamed in each script i.e.:

* `plot_matplotlib` in [pyscript_pandas_app.html](https://github.com/nckz/nckz.github.io/blob/hugo/layouts/shortcodes/pyscript_pandas_app.html)
* `plot_plotly` in [pyscript_pandas_plotly_app.html](https://github.com/nckz/nckz.github.io/blob/hugo/layouts/shortcodes/pyscript_pandas_plotly_app.html)

I suppose this should've been expected since the page is the scope.
